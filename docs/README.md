Topic Overview
* Dynamic Array <= Value list type
* Hashtable/Map
* Recursive Algorithms <= Visitor
* Stacks
    I use a std::vector much in the same way that you would use a stack,
    but in this case it's just indexable. I find this particularly useful
    because it gives me all the fifo proporties of a stack, with the
    indexabiliy and searchability of a dynamic array.
